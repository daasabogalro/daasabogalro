I'm a bioinformatician graduating from the Master's program in Bioinformatics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. My work focuses on developing computational solutions for biological data analysis.

## 🧬 Current Research

My master's thesis involves developing a Nextflow workflow for population genetics analysis using Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). I've also worked on analyzing water samples from the Bogotá River to identify antibiotic resistance genes.

## 💻 Interests & Skills

- **Bioinformatics**: Metagenomics, population genetics, antimicrobial resistance
- **Pipeline Development**: Nextflow workflows, reproducible analysis
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Infrastructure automation and deployment

## 📜 Certifications

- Python Programming
- Machine Learning
- Linux System Administration
- Git & GitHub
- Nextflow

## 🔭 What I'm looking for

I'm interested in opportunities that combine bioinformatics with modern software development practices, particularly in cloud-based solutions and scalable data analysis pipelines.
